# Placement-Prediction-system
🎓 Indian Engineering Student Placement Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project builds a binary classification pipeline to predict whether an Indian engineering student gets placed, using demographic, academic, and socio-economic features.
The model uses Logistic Regression, with categorical encoding, class imbalance handling via SMOTENC, and standard evaluation metrics.

The workflow is exploratory → preprocessing → resampling → modeling → evaluation.
No magic. Just fundamentals done (mostly) right.
